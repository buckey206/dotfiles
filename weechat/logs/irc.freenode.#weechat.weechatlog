2017-01-18 07:00:06	mgaunard1	I already searched the documentation, couldn't find it
2017-01-18 07:00:22	evilop	you aparently did not read /help mouse
2017-01-18 07:01:45	mgaunard1	I did, it just says it's for enabling/disabling the mouse
2017-01-18 07:01:57	mgaunard1	I don't want to disable the mouse, I just want to disable gestures
2017-01-18 07:01:58	evilop	which disables mouse guestures
2017-01-18 07:02:37	evilop	sidenote: you can hold down shift to disable it when you just want to mark something
2017-01-18 07:02:54	mgaunard1	I still want the mouse support to focus a given window
2017-01-18 07:03:10	evilop	then you will have to hack the code
2017-01-18 07:03:38	evilop	you can disable some of the guestures trough /set but not all iirc
2017-01-18 07:04:36	mgaunard1	I want to disable the switching between buffers
2017-01-18 07:04:46	mgaunard1	because I keep triggering this without wanting to
2017-01-18 07:05:05	creadak	take a look at /keys list
2017-01-18 07:05:26	creadak	Mouse gestures are kinda "keybindings"
2017-01-18 07:05:52	creadak	You can find the mouse bindings under the mouse context
2017-01-18 07:06:20	creadak	Find the one you want, to disable and /key unbind it
2017-01-18 07:07:30	creadak	I prefer using alt+m to toggle the mouse when I want the mouse on, less chance of mucking it up, but you can do what you want to do

2017-01-18 07:13:06	@FlashCode	mgaunard1: to disable gestures, you must rebind keys with mouse gestures to a command like /mute (which does nothing)
2017-01-18 07:13:36	@FlashCode	you can get mouse keys with /key list mouse
2017-01-18 07:13:51	creadak	Ah, I thought you could just unbind them.
2017-01-18 07:13:52	@FlashCode	if you remove keys this will work, but later a /key missing will restore them (which is not what you want)
2017-01-18 07:17:12	gb	i was thinking similar but did not know how to type it
2017-01-18 07:17:32	--	tehlarsie|afk is now known as tehlarsie
2017-01-18 07:19:05	gb	maybe you need a feature list where unwanted bindings could be added so when you did fix-missing it prompter user replace this binding ctrl y ctrl n like you get with pasting lotsa lines setting
2017-01-18 07:21:06	gb	or just display an error of this binding skipped because it is in blacklist keys.txt and have a blacklist set/unset command for those bindings you do not want replaced

2017-01-18 07:32:09	gb	how you can use wait
2017-01-18 07:32:40	gb	wait is not /upgrade or /quit tolerant though

2017-01-18 07:34:11	gb	Nikky: any of that help you ?
2017-01-18 07:34:56	Nikky	well like cron.py means that it saves the times to a file
2017-01-18 07:35:07	Nikky	and reloads them after a restart
2017-01-18 07:35:18	Nikky	so that multiple weeks reminders can work
