2017-01-18 08:04:16	DanielPowerNL	Hey guys, I'm trying to get true color (24bit) working in a terminal. I can get 256 color no problem just by setting TERM=xterm-256color. But I'm not sure how to get true color working. My terminal understands true color codes, but simply converts them to the nearest 256 color. I'd like to preferrably get this working with Xfce4-terminal or Terminator, but I will switch terminals if necessary. both vte and vte3 are installed. I understand I 
2017-01-18 08:04:16	DanielPowerNL	need vte3 for true color, but I'm not sure which one my terminals are compiled against, or how to change it.
2017-01-18 08:05:05	homerj	I want a terminal emulator that does vt340
