2017-01-18 03:45:08	fluffet	it was part of the welcoming of the new students. for a month i had to be anonymous in another costume, but there is a party for all committee members in the middle of all where you change suits with someone
2017-01-18 03:45:21	fluffet	for a day
2017-01-18 03:46:34	fluffet	so i changed with the president of a girls club :D

2017-01-18 03:46:59	fluffet	had to march around like that for an hour while not speaking to anyone
2017-01-18 03:47:39	fluffet	it was very weird but very liberating, since i changed with the president i was the only one who was allowed to stand in the slope that leads up to campus as a "representitive" of that club
2017-01-18 03:48:08	fluffet	so basically thousands of new students biked by me when i looked like that :D

2017-01-18 11:36:38	Yggdrasil	well when he is manic he feels on top of the world, he wants to stay like that, but he gets out of control
2017-01-18 11:36:55	moofunk	yeah
2017-01-18 11:37:08	Yggdrasil	buys a lot of stuff, says he is going to be the worlds best counter strike player etc.

2017-01-18 11:38:02	Yggdrasil	yeah
2017-01-18 11:38:43	Yggdrasil	I think it's because he didn't take his meds he became manic
