2017-01-18 08:01:50	homerj	arch is great
2017-01-18 08:01:58	@NaughtySquid	i do need to learn how to upgrade AUR packages though
2017-01-18 08:02:03	homerj	pacaur
2017-01-18 08:02:09	xpander69	pacman -Syua works also
2017-01-18 08:02:10	homerj	then pacaur -Syu
2017-01-18 08:02:16	libgradev	pacaur - 2nd that
2017-01-18 08:02:21	@NaughtySquid	hmm
2017-01-18 08:02:30	@BTRE	I think antergos comes with yaourt by default
2017-01-18 08:02:31	@NaughtySquid	will it selectively only update stuff i've install manually from the AUR?
2017-01-18 08:02:54	homerj	if there's an updated aur package, it will build it
2017-01-18 08:02:55	xpander69	uhh yaourt -Syua i wanted to say.. as antergos has yaourt as default i think
2017-01-18 08:03:06	homerj	yaourt is for suckers
2017-01-18 08:03:10	xpander69	u suck
2017-01-18 08:03:14	libgradev	when I moved to Linux originally I ended up on Arch - and haven't changed since...
2017-01-18 08:03:27	@NaughtySquid	oh wow
2017-01-18 08:03:31	@NaughtySquid	yaourt -Syua is exactly what i wanted :D
2017-01-18 08:03:49	homerj	I only installed Arch for one reason, when I had an amd card, it was the most painless way to install Catalyst
2017-01-18 08:04:01	@NaughtySquid	so that command checks for updates on all packages, plus those i've installed from AUR?
2017-01-18 08:04:06	homerj	yes
2017-01-18 08:04:07	xpander69	yes

2017-01-18 08:04:33	uso_	but you still need to confirme the aur [ackage
2017-01-18 08:04:43	@NaughtySquid	yeah i saw that
2017-01-18 08:04:45	@NaughtySquid	had obs to update
2017-01-18 08:04:49	xpander69	yeah for that you can use yaourt -Syua --noconfirm

2017-01-18 08:59:50	von	dmenu has its ow issue, but it's fuzzy search does not give me problems
2017-01-18 09:00:10	Grifter	i couldn't get i3 to work with separate X screens when i tried it, is that still impossible?
2017-01-18 09:00:10	libgradev	I just use dmenu
2017-01-18 09:00:28	von	Grifter, what do you mean by that?
2017-01-18 09:00:47	von	i3's multi monitor support is superb
2017-01-18 09:00:49	libgradev	Grifter: I'm using it with multiple simultaneous X sessions if that helps
2017-01-18 09:00:56	Grifter	i mean multiple monitors, each set up as a separate X screen, only the primary worked in i3, the others were non-interactable
2017-01-18 09:01:04	libgradev	each using 3 screens
2017-01-18 09:01:06	von	ah, that
2017-01-18 09:01:18	von	maybe you have to run a separate i3 session on each screen?
2017-01-18 09:01:28	von	are there even wms that do support that kind of setup?
2017-01-18 09:01:32	Grifter	that defeats the purpose of a window manager, now i'm managing the window manager
2017-01-18 09:01:51	Grifter	yes, all wms used to do it, but i don't think they do anymore
2017-01-18 09:01:57	libgradev	ah, ok
2017-01-18 09:02:10	libgradev	why did you want that ooi?
2017-01-18 09:02:28	Grifter	so i can control each individual monitor through ssh
2017-01-18 09:03:35	libgradev	use case?
2017-01-18 09:04:03	Grifter	i thought i just gave one :p
2017-01-18 09:04:05	Grifter	but let's say
2017-01-18 09:04:10	libgradev	lol, end goal then
2017-01-18 09:04:26	Grifter	you ssh in and want to mplayer on one monitor, but then change your mind, you want the output on a different monitor
2017-01-18 09:04:48	Grifter	DISPLAY=:0.1 mplayer foo, DISPLAY=:0.2 mplayer foo
2017-01-18 09:05:11	libgradev	ah ok
2017-01-18 09:05:26	von	I probably should try awesome 4, haven't used awesome in a while now.
2017-01-18 09:05:31	homerj	sometimes I work with a lot of windows, and it would be nice to have tiling
2017-01-18 09:05:40	homerj	but I can never figure out how to move the windows around
2017-01-18 09:05:51	Grifter	the whole point is to not move them around :p
2017-01-18 09:05:54	homerj	that's what really got me
2017-01-18 09:05:58	libgradev	Grifter: something like winswitch any use?
2017-01-18 09:06:08	Grifter	never heard of it, libgradev what's that
2017-01-18 09:06:49	libgradev	renders the client to a detatched (background) X session which you can attach to any running X session
2017-01-18 09:07:11	libgradev	allows you to move apps between X sessions
2017-01-18 09:07:35	Grifter	does it use a nested X server to do some jiggery-hackery?
2017-01-18 09:07:37	von	homerj, generally, with hotkeys
2017-01-18 09:08:01	homerj	Grifter, well, for instance I'm writing a paper, I have emacs, browser, pdf, etc. open
2017-01-18 09:08:05	von	also if you want to run mostly floating, with only occasional tiling, you probably should try awesome.
2017-01-18 09:08:18	homerj	I end up with emacs in a sliver a window on the side, and I can't make it the main window
2017-01-18 09:08:28	homerj	or then go "ok, I want the pdf to be 1/2 the screen
2017-01-18 09:08:33	libgradev	von: I used Awesome for about a year then left it - had some flaws which I haven't hit in i3

2017-01-18 09:10:45	Grifter	it sounds interesting but it's kind of backwards of what i use it for, in this case you use it like screen, ie you're actively at the monitor and attaching it to a new place, but what i like with having a separate X screen is being able to ssh in and control stuff without needing to be at the monitor itself

2017-01-18 09:11:17	von	homerj, dwm and its derivatives (including awesome) have the 'main window' concept, when you have multiple windows tiled on the screen with one bigger than the others, and you just move the window you want to work with there
2017-01-18 09:11:39	libgradev	yeah, I get where you're coming from. I wondered if there might be remote control built in...
2017-01-18 09:12:31	Grifter	i think it's just the nature of the beast, i think new window managers don't really incorporate that aspect anymore (openbox doesn't work with separate x screens either anymore, though it used to), so i'm stuck with my old wm
2017-01-18 09:12:39	libgradev	can't say I've ever had the need here
2017-01-18 09:12:56	von	libgradev, some of the awesome's flaws I've fixed myself while I was using it, like support for sublayouts or reverting floating window sizes on switching between floating / tiled
2017-01-18 09:13:54	von	chromium and some of its forks have a really weird bug, when they won't reattach tabs on the secondary screens.
2017-01-18 09:14:02	von	that I obviously couldn't fix :)

2017-01-18 09:15:38	libgradev	can't you just send a switch monitor command to a suitable WM?
2017-01-18 09:16:23	homerj	von, yeah, but I never quite figured them out
2017-01-18 09:16:33	homerj	the keyboard shortcuts, the configs, etc.
2017-01-18 09:16:42	von	yeah, takes time and getting used to
2017-01-18 09:17:05	Grifter	my wm works fine normally, i wouldn't mind having a newer wm like i3, but i also don't exactly need it
2017-01-18 09:17:30	libgradev	von: It used to do annoying things like stall out when the LAN connection was down and it crashed out UE4-Editor due to the way it handled dialogs...
2017-01-18 09:17:31	von	also I don't find the main window concept all that useful tbh, as well as tiling every window on the same screen. Too little space, I generally use tabbed layout, and an occasional window that I like to keep always visible on the side.
2017-01-18 09:17:40	von	so it's mostly always fullscreen
2017-01-18 09:17:43	Grifter	so it wouldn't be just switching the wm, it would be switching me, and i can't be arsed to do that yet, not enough upsides yet

2017-01-18 09:18:52	libgradev	Grifter: fair enough. Must be an alternative if WM's have been dropping the feature...
2017-01-18 09:18:56	von	libgradev, window rules man, can't use a tiling wm without them :)
2017-01-18 09:19:21	libgradev	i3 has them
2017-01-18 09:19:49	Grifter	i'm not sure why, but i don't know anything about it either, i think it's because of nvidia's driver making all monitors be one screen, i assume that's what pushed it in that direction
2017-01-18 09:19:58	von	my awesome config has like 150 lines with window rules applied.
2017-01-18 09:20:08	von	(mostly formatting though)
2017-01-18 09:20:20	von	libgradev, I think every tiling wm has to have them.
2017-01-18 09:20:43	von	but my point was if some program behaves funny in a tiling wm, just make a window rule for it to be always floating
2017-01-18 09:20:45	homerj	see, I'm also just lazy with configs
2017-01-18 09:21:50	von	I'd rather like for i3 to stop making floating windows always on top. It kinda makes sense, but annoys me quite a bit sometimes.
2017-01-18 09:23:10	von	Grifter, it's how X supports multi monitor setups really
2017-01-18 09:23:22	von	I don't think it has to do with nvidia or any other driver
2017-01-18 09:23:28	libgradev	von: ah, yeah, wouldn't have fixed the network issue and I don't know if it would have fixed UE4...
2017-01-18 09:23:39	von	dunno about the network issue
2017-01-18 09:23:46	Grifter	actually X's support of multi monitor is to use separate X screens, to bunch them all up is a kind of 'hack'
2017-01-18 09:23:58	von	maybe you used some custom shit to display network status or something
2017-01-18 09:24:07	von	could have been blocking awesome
2017-01-18 09:24:50	libgradev	von: believe I read Awesome was single threaded so the whole UI could stall if an addon stalled...
2017-01-18 09:25:19	von	libgradev, depends on how you write your addons I think, but yeah. There are some disadvantages to that.
2017-01-18 09:25:41	von	I remember running wmii, it was blocked by launching programs lol.
2017-01-18 09:25:57	von	"starting firefox? no, I don't think you can switch windows until it starts, sorry!"
2017-01-18 09:25:59	libgradev	I've never had i3 stall out, ever
2017-01-18 09:26:41	von	I've never had awesome stall out, but my only addon was asynchronous.
2017-01-18 09:26:53	libgradev	:)
2017-01-18 09:27:18	libgradev	Awesome was good generally though

2017-01-18 09:27:31	libgradev	yep :)
2017-01-18 09:28:21	von	speaking of i3, I've replaced i3status with a small tool in python that can be extended with plugins

2017-01-18 09:32:36	von	yeah, but I generally don't have ones that I need to access for a few second and then out of sight. I'm mostly fine with spreading them between tags.

2017-01-18 10:19:31	Sonolin	*as much packages
2017-01-18 10:19:36	Cracker	sonolin: so what arch needs to compile from source today to get cpu specific instructions that make a real difference?
2017-01-18 10:19:59	Sonolin	things that don't compile from the AUR natively on ARM, for example...
2017-01-18 10:20:11	Sonolin	at least without manual intervention (then, really, what's the point of the AUR?)
2017-01-18 10:20:29	qptain_Nemo	is it really that bad on arm?

2017-01-18 10:44:24	uso_	and I never get how to do a match in haskell as the syntaxe use indentation, so I generally go back to Ocaml or C after 5mn trying to have the eindentation corectelly
2017-01-18 10:44:25	Sonolin	although i3 comes close
2017-01-18 10:45:00	Sonolin	ah well indentation in haskell is more "indent at least this much" - you just have to make sure the next block is indented more than the previous
2017-01-18 10:45:11	Sonolin	took a bit getting used to, but it gives you lots of flexibility with spacing

2017-01-18 11:21:51	jeremyc	Assuming that works.. If the game is CPU bottlenecked, will the GPU show as less than 100% in use? Or will the GPU still be pegged?
